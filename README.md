## Deployment Status
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bf86eb52-8769-455c-ab56-a095fd2d0e69/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jolly-yonath-ebbba1/deploys)

## Stack

### Backend
At this point, the backend consists entirely of http requests to [robohash.org](robohash.org). Seriously, that's it. We may add some fancy caching in the future to try to reverse engineer their site, but that would be ridiculous so there is definitely a possibility.

## Frontend
The Frontend is a React.js app generated by Next.js, pushed to Github, and deployed through Netlify.

## Why?

Primarily nostalgia. Remembering back to the good old days when you just uploaded a raw HTML file to an FTP server, pointed your domain to `whatever.com`, poof - you is on the interwebs, baby! Sure we couldn't do much back then, but it was easy, and if you knew the right place to look, **FREE**! ..Other than the domain registration, of course ;) But the most important part as that it was **FUN**!

## How?

This project started out as a doodle on [codesandbox.com](codesandbox.com), just experimenting with very basic React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`. It then got exported into a zipfile and the code for the components were refactored into a basic Next.js app (which was suprisingly simple). 

After that, a repo  was created on [github.com](github.com), a few configuration files got adjusted, set up a few parameters entered on [Netlify](netlify.com) and boom --> DEPLOYED.

Then nostalgia took over, and the search for a good domain name commenced: [robothnter.net](robothunter.net) happened to be available...

## Contributing

This is an open source project and all are welcome to contribute, just don't be a jerk. A code of conduct will be implemented if people start acting mean to each other. But we would rather not have to do that so just don't.

Feel free to add issues if you spot bugs or make a pull request if you come up with some amazing feature that you think we just must add to [robothunter.net](robothunter.net)

If you see open issues and are feeling up to it, go ahead, come up with a fix and send a pull request. Just remember, this project is primarily for **FUN**! Even if you want to add some serious code to the project, the point is to do it in a way that keeps the tone lighthearted. Copy pasting from stack overflow is totally allowed, but only if you brag about it and it actually enhances the UI. ðŸ¤£ 

## Complaints

Feel free to complain about how terrible the code is, or layout or whatever. JUST DON'T BE MEAN! And if you are gonna complain, why not offer a better solution anyhow with a pull request that can actually improve the project. Then we will all learn something and you get to show off your superior skills.
